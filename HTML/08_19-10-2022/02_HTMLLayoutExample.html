      <h1>HTML History</h1>
      <p>
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
        constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be
        embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
        structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
        headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML
        elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such
        as directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as
      </p>
      <p>
        surround and provide information about document text and may include
        other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but
        use them to interpret the content of the page.

      <p>
        The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called
        "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late
        1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively
        simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly
        influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language
        (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements
        still exist in HTML 4.[8]
      </p>

      <p>
        Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was
        formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
        with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML
        specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by
        Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type
        definition to define the grammar.[9][10] The draft expired after six
        months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic
        browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's
        philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave
        Raggett's competing Internet-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)",
        from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features
        like tables and fill-out forms.[11]
